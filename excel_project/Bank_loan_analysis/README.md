# Bank Loan Analysis – Excel Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyses a financial loan dataset to monitor lending performance and assess the overall health of a loan portfolio. Using Microsoft Excel, key loan metrics are explored and visualised to support data-driven insights into loan trends, borrower characteristics, and portfolio risk.

The dashboards are designed to provide both a high-level overview and a focused summary of loan performance.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains structured loan-level information, including:
- Loan amount and funded amount
- Amount received
- Interest rate
- Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio
- Loan status
- Loan purpose
- Employment length
- Home ownership
- Geographic information (state)

---

## Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Excel
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Excel formulas
- Pivot tables and pivot charts
- Interactive dashboards with slicers

---

## Key Questions Addressed
- How many loan applications have been received, and how do they trend over time?
- What is the total funded amount compared to the total amount received?
- How do interest rates and DTI vary across loan statuses?
- What proportion of loans are classified as good versus bad loans?
- Which loan purposes and borrower characteristics drive the highest application volumes?
- How is loan activity distributed across states, employment length, and home ownership status?

## Dashboard Preview

### Overview Dashboard
The overview dashboard presents high-level lending metrics such as total loan applications, funded amount, amount received, average interest rate, and average DTI. It also visualises trends over time and distributions by state, loan term, employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership. Interactive filters allow users to explore patterns by loan grade and purpose.

### Summary Dashboard
The summary dashboard focuses on loan performance and risk by comparing good and bad loans. It highlights their proportions, funded amounts, and amounts received, alongside comparisons of interest rates and DTI by loan status to support portfolio risk assessment.
