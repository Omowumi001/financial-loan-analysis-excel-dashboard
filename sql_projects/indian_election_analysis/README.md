# India 2024 General Election – SQL Analysis

## Overview
This project uses SQL to analyse the 2024 Indian General Election dataset, focusing on seat distribution, party performance, alliance outcomes, and state-level results. The analysis explores how parliamentary seats are allocated across states and parties, providing insight into election outcomes and political trends.

The project demonstrates practical SQL skills applied to a real-world, multi-table dataset.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the India 2024 General Election dataset, which includes:
- Constituency-level election results
- State-wise election data
- Party-wise results
- Alliance and party affiliations
- Total parliamentary constituencies

Multiple tables were combined to perform state-level, party-level, and alliance-level analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL querying and data exploration
- INNER JOINs across multiple tables
- Aggregations using COUNT and SUM
- Conditional logic using CASE statements
- Grouping and summarisation
- Analytical reasoning using real election data

---

## Key Questions Addressed
- What is the total number of parliamentary seats in the Indian General Election?
- How many seats are available for election in each state?
- How are parliamentary seats distributed across states?
- How many total seats were won by major political alliances (e.g., NDA)?
- How do party and alliance-level performances compare at a national level?

---

## Analysis Highlights
- Calculated the total number of parliamentary constituencies contested in the election.
- Determined state-wise seat allocation by joining constituency and state datasets.
- Aggregated seat counts to evaluate performance of major political alliances using conditional logic.
- Performed structured analysis across constituency, state, and party dimensions.
