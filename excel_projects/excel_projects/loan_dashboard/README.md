- Pivot tables & pivot charts
- Excel formulas (IF, XLOOKUP, SUMIFS)
- Dashboard design (KPIs + filters/slicers)

## Key Questions Addressed
- How many loan applications have been received and how do they trend over time?
- What proportion of loans are good versus bad, and how do their funded amounts differ?
- How do interest rates and DTI vary by loan status?
- Which loan purposes and borrower characteristics drive the highest application volumes?
- How is loan activity distributed across states and employment lengths?
